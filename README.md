Creating a Twitter Bot with Python

How about writing a script that logs in a twitter account, look for a particular hashtag, and automatically follows top accounts on that word. Not just that, it will retweet top tweets, favorite them, and even reply to them !

This can be so good for your social media marketing campaigns, without having to do much, just run a script !

Use the command prompt to install tweepy and tkinter modules. Then go to Twitter – https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps – If you dont have a developer account you have to apply for one and wait for a day or two. (Dont worry, you dont have to be a twitter developer to get a developer account on twitter, anyone can apply and get one.) From the above page, go to Create An App – Keys & Tokens. There you will find these 4 tokens that are important for this python script to run.

Once you have these, running the below script is a breeze and you don’t have to input anything else. Once you execute the script it will open a GUI where you have to input the target keyword, and answer a few simple questions – and thats it ! Check your twitter account to see that magic is done !

Check your twitter profile and see the Tweets, Tweets with Replies, Likes etc to see what script did effortlessly !

Hope you enjoyed doing these small, yet fun exercises and feel the immense power python has !

The above Ten python projects are helpful to introduce practical application through the Python programming language. Implementing these projects introduces important concepts such as file handling and GUI design to a beginner programmer. You can simply open IDLE, copy the code and see the magic !

Concluding our list of a handful of interesting ideas and projects you can build using Python, we can say that Python can be a very useful programming language to develop applications of all sorts and scales. To wrap things up, I would like to say the potential with Python is limitless, and the only thing that you might be missing could be the right idea !
